## Welcome to the AOS projects development website![**Art Of Sequence**](http://artofsequence.org) is a **set of open-source technologies for digital story-telling**. [By **digital story-telling** we mean any kind of narratives that exploit one or more unique feature of digital platforms](http://artofsequence.org/?page_id=42). 

AOS is composed of several projects which try to solve different issues of digital narratives creation and publication:
 * [AOSL](https://github.com/artofsequence/aosl): an universal format to represent digital stories (it's XML-based), which is used by all tools and most interpreters;
 * [AOS Designer](https://github.com/artofsequence/aos-designer): a visual editor to help authors to story-board and mount digital stories, which will host exporters;
 * [AOS Web Player](https://github.com/artofsequence/aos-webplayer): a Javascript interpreter of AOSL files - there is a demo online: http://demo.artofsequence.org ;
 * [and many other projects!](https://github.com/artofsequence/aos-all/wiki)

Need **more information** about the idea or maybe the **last news about the project**? Check the main website: http://artofsequence.org

## Licensing

The purpose of these projects is to be **a base on which companies can rely to make better tools, formats and interpreters for digital stories**. Following this objective, **all the base projects have [the MIT license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)**. 

I (Joel Lamotte) plan to do some commercial works in the future that will rely on this MIT code. These commercial projets may or may not be open source, but they will be separated from the base code. **All code exposed in https://github.com/artofsequence/ ** have [MIT license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). If you find missing mentions of licencing, please contact me or create an issue in the appropriate project.
