== Definitions

=== type ===

Specifiy the constraints and usage of data.

[WARNING]
====
Add an XML/XSD example here.
====

=== element ===

An instance of an type, implemented as a node in the DOM Node Tree.
The constraints of the type are applied to the data stored by the element.
An element can contain other elements if the constraints described by the type allows it.

[WARNING]
====
Add an XML example here.
====

=== attribute ===

Key-value property of an element with a semantic is defined by the type.

====
    
=== decimal-type ===

A native decimal type.

[NOTE]
====
In XSD, a decimal-type type could be implemented as a +xs:double+ or +xsd:decimal+ type.
In $$C++$$, a decimal-type could be implemented as a $$C++$$'s +double+ or +float+ type.
====

=== string-type ===

A type which can contain textual values, with or without additional constraints.

[NOTE]
====
In XSD, a string-type type could be implemented as a +xs:string+ or +xsd:anyURI+ type 
 (in case we want to add URI scheme constraints to the textual value).
In $$C++$$, a string-type could be implemented as a $$C++$$'s +std::string+ or +const char*+ type 
or a wrapper type around a +std::string+ which would add necessary constraints.
====
    

=== interpreter ===

The interpreter is the implementation that will read the AOSL data and apply it's semantic.

[NOTE]
====
Examples of interpreters implementation: 

    - an exporter converting AOSL data to another specific format;
    - a player embedded in a web page to interpret on-the-fly AOSL data and display the result to the reader;
    - a library interpreting the semantic of AOSL data and providing a description of the 
        interpreted state of the reading to the user code (for example to allow a preview in an editor,
        or as part of an implementation of player application).
