=== box ===

. +box+ is a type representing a geometric 3D box in space.

. +box+ is composed of the following elements which can appear in any order:
+
|===
| *Element Name*  | *Type*          | *Occurence*      | *Semantic*     
| +size+       | +vector+        | Once or none.    |
    Size of the box.
    Each one of the axes value gives the length of the corresponding edges of the box.
    If not provided, the default size should be determined by the implementation.
    In this case, if it is the ouput or input box of a graphic object, the default value is 100% of the resource size.  
| +transformation+              | +transformation+        | Once or none.  |
    Transformation defining the position, 
    orientation and scale factor of this box, 
    relative to the parent object or the canvas origin if no parent.

=== spatial_area ===

. +spatial_area+ is a type representing a 3D area.
+
WARNING: Needs a lot of clarifications...maybe just remove that type?

. +spatial_area+ must be implemented as a +vector+ and must expose +vector+'s interface.

=== source_uri ===

. +source_uri+ is a type representing the URI identifying a resource.
. +source_uri+ must be implemented as a string-type with the following additional constraints:
    - the text value must be conformant with the URI scheme specification (see <<rfc-uri,RFC-3986>>).
+
[NOTE]
====
As specified in <<rfc-uri,RFC-3986>> (see <<section_required_references>>), an URI can be a local filesystem file address, 
an online URL or something else. It is volontarily unspecified here how it must be interpreted.
As with almost all the values represented in AOSL, the interpreter implementation will define 
(and provide to tools for preventive checking) it's own additional constraints. 
For example, XAOSL adds that the URI must be relative to some files internal to the 
XAOSL container file system. An interpreter in a web page might add a constraint forcing
all URIs to be URLs and use them as such to retrieve resources.

=== extension ===

. +extension+ is a type representing an extension point.
. +extension+'s attributes and child elements are unspecified: it can contain any attributes and any elements.
. An interpreter is allowed to read and interpret the data in an +extension+ element if it can.
. An interpreter unable to read or interpret the data in an +extension+ element must ignore these data.
+
[NOTE]
====
+extension+ allows specifics interpreters implementations to provide additional functionalities which will 
be ignored by other interpreters implementations which are not able to use them. 
Therefore, +extension+ is not portable but helps experiment with new fonctionalities which could be 
added later to AOSL.

       - +A+, +B+, +C+, +D+, +E+, +F+, +G+, +H+, +I+, +J+, +K+, +L+, +M+, +N+, +O+, +P+, +Q+, +R+, +S+, +T+, +U+, +V+, +W+, +X+, +Y+, +Z+;
